## Step 2 - Climate App

* The following routes where created using Flask 

### Routes

* `/`
  * Home page.

* `/api/v1.0/precipitation`

![prep_app](Images/precipapp.jpg)


* `/api/v1.0/stations`

![station_app_](Images/stationsapp.jpg)

* `/api/v1.0/tobs`

![temp](Images/tobsapp.jpg)

* `/api/v1.0/<start>` and `/api/v1.0/<start>/<end>`

## Part 3: Data Analyses


### Temperature Analysis I

* Average temperature in June at all stations across all available years in the dataset. 

 ![june_temp](Images/JuneAveTemp.jpg)

* Average temperature in December at all stations across all available years in the dataset.

 ![dec_temp](Images/DecAveTemp.jpg)

* The p-value of the test is 3.902513e-191, which is less than the significance level alpha (e.g., 0.05). This means that we can conclude that the Average Temperature in Hawai in June is statistically different from the Average Temperature in Hawai in December
